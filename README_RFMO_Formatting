#The following steps were taken to format the raw RFMO data for spatialization as of June 2018:

#======================CCSBT======================
#Dowload the CCSBT nominal and spatial datasets here: https://www.ccsbt.org/en/content/sbt-data
#Nominal: "Annual catch by flag or gear from 1952 to 2016 inclusive"
#Spatial: "Catch by year, month, gear, ocean and 5 degree grid from 1965 to 2016 inclusive"

#Prior to the 2013, CCSBT reported their data by fishing country by gear
#They now report by flag OR by  gear
#We used an old dataset for 1952-2012 as the totals matched the new data, previously called "SBT_Catch" when downloaded off of the CCSBT website
#Then we used the gear proportions of each fishing country by ocean in 2012 to disaggregate the 2013-2016 data, from the file called "CatchByOYF" when downloaded off of the CCSBT website

#To prepare the disaggregated 1952-2015 nominal data for formatting, we did the following:
#Change column name "YEAR" to "Year". 
#Change column name "Country_CODE" to "CountryName".
#Change column name "GEAR_CODE" to "GearName".
#Change column name "OCEAN_CODE" to "OceanName".
#Change column name "WEIGHT" to "Catch".
#Save file as a *csv, named "INPUT CCSBT Nominal Catch For Formatting.csv"

#Open CCSBT raw spatial data, called "CatchByYMGOLoLa" when downloaded off of the CCSBT website
#Delete rows 1 through 6 (spreadsheet should start with column headings). 
#Change column name "Calendar Year" to "Year".
#Change column name "Gear" to "GearName".
#Change column name "Ocean" to "OceanName".
#Change column name "Latitude" to "Lat".
#Change column name "Longitude to "Lon"
#Change column name "Tonnes" to "Catch".
#Make sure the catch column does not contain commas (thousands separators). 
#Save file as a *csv, named "INPUT CCSBT Spatial Catch For Formatting.csv". 


#======================IATTC======================
#Dowload the IATTC nominal and spatial datasets here: https://www.iattc.org/Catchbygear/IATTC-Catch-by-species1.htm
#Nominal = "EPO total estimated catch by year, flag, gear, species"
#Spatial = "Tuna EPO purse seine catch and effort aggregated by year, month, flag or set type, 1?x1?", "Billfish EPO purse seine catch and effort aggregated by year, month, flag or set type, 1?x1?","Shark EPO purse seine catch and effort aggregated by year, month, flag or set type, 1?x1?","Tuna and billfish EPO longline catch and effort aggregated by year, month, flag, 5?x5?","Shark EPO longline catch and effort aggregated by year, month, flag, 5?x5?","Tuna EPO pole and line catch and effort aggregated by year, month, flag, 1?x1?"

#To prepare the disaggregated 1918-2016 nominal data for formatting, we did the following:
#Open IATTC raw nominal data, called "CatchFlagGear1918-2016" when downloaded off of the IATTC website
#Change column name "AnoYear" to "Year". 
#Change column name "BanderaFlag" to "Flag".
#Change column name "ArteGear" to "Gear".
#Change column name "EspeciesSpecies" to "Species".
#Change column name "t" to "Catch".
#Save file as a *csv, named "INPUT IATTC Nominal Catch For Formatting.csv".

#IATTC spatial data is split by target taxon group and gear, 6 separate files
#To prepare the files we did the following, raw data file names from the website downloads in brackets

#Purse Seine

#Billfish (PublicPSBillfishFlag) /Tuna (PublicPSTunaFlag)
#Change column name "LatC1" to "Lat". 
#Change column name "LonC1" to "Lon". 
#Delete the column "Month".

#Spatial = "All CE files", this contained three datasets for surface, longline and coastal fleets

#To prepare the nominal data for formatting, we did the following:

#======================WCPFC======================
#Dowload the WCPFC nominal dataset here: https://www.wcpfc.int/doc/wcpfc-tuna-fishery-yearbook-2016-excel-files
#Dowload the WCPFC spatial datasets here: https://www.wcpfc.int/node/4648

#To prepare the nominal data for formatting, we did the following:
#Open WCPFC raw nominal data, called "YB_WCP_CA" when downloaded off of the WCPFC website
#Change column name “yy” to “Year”. 
#Change column name “gear” to “Gear”.
#Change column name “flag” to “Flag”.
#Delete “fleet” column.
#Make sure only species catch columns with “_mt” are included. This is catch in metric tonnes, as opposed to catch in numbers (present in some databases). 
#Save file as a *csv, named “INPUT WCPFC Nominal Catch For Formatting.csv”.

#The WCPFC spatial datasets are separated into gears in DBF format

#To prepare the longline spatial datasets, we did the following:
#Longline datasets are organized in decades, denoted by the last two digits in the file name. For example: "LONGLINE_00.DBF"
#Change column name “YY,N,4,0” to “Year”.
#Change column name “MM,N,4,0” to “Month”.
#Change column name “Lat5,C,3” to “Lat”.
#Change column name “Lon5,C,4” to “Lon”
#Delete column “HHooks,N,16,2”.
#Delete all species name columns with “_N”. This will only leave catch in metric tonnes, as opposed to catch in numbers. 
#Save file as a *csv, named “INPUT WCPFC Spatial Longline [00] For Formatting.csv”. The number in brackets should correspond to each longline database (60, 70, 80, 90, 00).


#The purse seine, pole and line and driftnet datasets are contained in one file per gear
#Open IOTC spatial catch data. These file are named "DRIFTNET.DBF","POLE_AND_LINE.DBF" and "PURSE_SEINE.DBF"
#Change column name “YY,N,4,0” to “Year”.
#Change column name “MM,N,4,0” to “Month”.
#Change column name “Lat5,C,3” to “Lat”.
#Change column name “Lon5,C,4” to “Lon”
#Delete column “Days,N,16,2”.
#Save file as a *csv, named “INPUT WCPFC Spatial [Purse Seine] For Formatting.csv”. Name in brackets is changed for subsequent gears.
